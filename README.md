# latency-lab 🚀  
**Network Telemetry + Real-Time Visualization**

This is a project I built to combine my interests in **networking, backend systems, and real-time data visualization**.  
`latency-lab` is a lightweight observability stack that measures latency, jitter, and packet loss across multiple targets, then visualizes everything in a clean dashboard.

## 💡 Why I Built It
I wanted to create something that felt like a real-world engineering tool — something that touches async systems, REST APIs, and live dashboards all in one stack.  
`latency-lab` is meant to show what I can do across multiple areas:
- **Systems thinking:** async I/O, retry logic, structured logging  
- **Networking:** ICMP ping probing, jitter + packet-loss tracking  
- **Backend:** FastAPI server, SQLite database, JSON APIs  
- **Frontend:** real-time visualization using HTMX + Chart.js  
- **DevOps:** containerized setup with Docker + GitHub Actions CI
